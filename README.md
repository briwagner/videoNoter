# videoNoter
Webapp for note-taking with online videos, based on Mozilla's Popcorn JS library.

I coded this to fill a need I have for collecting notes from producers/editors for videos in the process of being finalized. The big issue is collecting accurate time codes for a video. Popcorn.js handles that portion. I built the note-taking portion around that, with options for managing scripts as well. Also builds on Bootstrap for css.
